      <h2 className="section-title">Introduction:</h2>
      <p>
        Managing time during preparation â€” and during the exam itself â€” can make or break your CAT score.
        Itâ€™s not just about how much you know; itâ€™s about how efficiently you apply that knowledge under pressure.
        Many bright students lose marks not because they didnâ€™t know the answer, but because they spent too
        much time on tough questions, panicked under time pressure, or couldnâ€™t plan their preparation well.
        The good news? Time management is a skill you can learn and master â€” with the right approach and consistent practice.
        <br /><br />
        Here are five proven strategies straight from CAT toppers and Tathagat mentors that can help you maximize every minute.
      </p>

      <h3 className="tip-heading">1. Prioritize High-Impact Topics</h3>
      <p>
        Not all topics are created equal. Some areas consistently carry more weight in the exam â€”
        mastering these gives you a better return on your time investment.
        <br />âœ” Identify the most important topics based on past CAT papers (e.g., Arithmetic, Algebra in Quant; Reading Comprehension in Verbal).
        <br />âœ” Devote more time to mastering these before moving to less-weighted areas.
        <br /><strong>Tip:</strong> <br />
        Create a simple checklist and update it weekly to track your command over high-impact topics.
      </p>

      <h3 className="tip-heading">2. Train Early with Full-Length Mocks</h3>
      <p>
        Mocks are your best friends.
        <br />âœ” Start taking full-length mock tests early â€” ideally 3â€“4 months before the exam.
        <br />âœ” Analyze your performance: look beyond scores; check where you spent too much time, where you guessed, and where you skipped.
        <br /><strong>Important:</strong> <br />
        Mock tests should simulate real exam conditions â€” same time slots, same environment, and no distractions.
      </p>

      <h3 className="tip-heading">3. Master the Art of Skipping</h3>
      <p>
        Time management inside the exam hall is all about smart decision-making.
        <br />âœ” Donâ€™t get emotionally attached to questions.
        <br />âœ” If a question looks lengthy, tricky, or confusing in the first few seconds, skip it and move on.
        <br />âœ” Come back later if time permits â€” after all, CAT rewards accuracy, not ego!
        <br /><strong>Remember:</strong> <br />
        Sometimes, not attempting a tough question is a winning move.

      <div className="final-tip">
        <h3>4. Study in Small, Intense Bursts</h3>
        <p>
          Long study hours without focus can drain your energy without real progress.
          <br />âœ” Instead, use techniques like Pomodoro (25 minutes focused study + 5 minutes break).
          <br />âœ” Break your day into 2â€“3 focused sessions â€” Quant in the morning, Verbal and LRDI in the evening.
          <br /><strong>Example Routine:</strong>
          <br />â€¢ 8 AM â€“ 10 AM: Quantitative Aptitude practice
          <br />â€¢ 5 PM â€“ 6:30 PM: Verbal Ability practice
          <br />â€¢ 9 PM â€“ 10 PM: Mock Analysis
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="final-tip">
        <h3>5. Build Exam-Day Endurance</h3>
        <p>
          CAT is a 2-hour mental marathon. You must train your brain for sustained focus.
          <br />âœ” Practice sitting for long periods without distractions.
          <br />âœ” Take back-to-back mocks closer to the exam day to build stamina.
          <br /><strong>Pro Tip:</strong>
          <br />Simulate the emotional pressure too â€” treat mocks seriously so you get used to performing under stress.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="final-conclusion">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Time management isnâ€™t a trick you pull out on exam day â€” itâ€™s a habit you build over months of smart preparation.
          <br />
          Start applying these strategies now. Break your studies into achievable goals. Practice under pressure. Stay consistent.
          <br />
          By exam day, time will no longer be your enemy â€” it will be your secret weapon.
