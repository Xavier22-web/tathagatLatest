Choose the best answer to each question.\n\nCuttlefish are full of personality, as behavioral ecologist Alexandra Schnell found out while researching the cephalopod's potential to display self-control. Schnell, who is based at the University of Cambridge, spent months in 2019 training 29 European cuttlefish to approach a platform that would deliver food. But the individuals varied dramatically, she says. Some were \"very hesitant\" and took a long time to approach the platform or food at all, while others were \"very bold\" and didn't seem to care about anything.\n\nWhat was the primary purpose of Schnell's 2019 research with cuttlefish?",
